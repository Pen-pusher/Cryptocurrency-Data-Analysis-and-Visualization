# 5- Are there any patterns in the data? If yes, what are they and why do you think they are patterns?
answer - 
# From the graph generated by the code, we can observe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant price increases over the past 30 days. Bitcoin had a steady increase in price until around March 13, 2023, where it peaked at around $96,000 USD, before experiencing a slight drop in price. Ethereum had a similar increase in price, reaching a peak of around $3,300 USD on March 14, 2023, before also experiencing a slight drop in price.

# These patterns could potentially be attributed to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, news events, and more. It's difficult to pinpoint a specific reason for these patterns without further analysis and context. However, it's important to note that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and subject to fluctuations, so it's not uncommon to see sudden increases or decreases in price.



# 6- How do the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum vary across different time frames (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly)? Are there any notable differences in price trends or volatility across these time frames?
answer -

# - import requests

# base_url = 'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/'

# # Define the cryptocurrency and time intervals
# crypto = ['bitcoin', 'ethereum']
# intervals = ['1d', '7d', '30d']

# # Make API calls to get the prices for each cryptocurrency and time interval
# for c in crypto:
#     print(f'Prices for {c.capitalize()}:')
#     for i in intervals:
#         url = f'{base_url}coins/{c}/market_chart?vs_currency=usd&days={i}'
#         response = requests.get(url)
#         data = response.json()
#         prices = [p[1] for p in data['prices']]
#         price_change = (prices[-1] - prices[0]) / prices[0] * 100
#         print(f'{i.capitalize()} Price: ${prices[-1]:,.2f} ({price_change:+.2f}%)')
#     print()


# Based on the data provided by the code , we can see that the prices of both Bitcoin and Ethereum have varied across different time frames, specifically 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.

# For Bitcoin, we can see that the prices have increased slightly over the past day (1d), while showing a much stronger increase over the past 7 days (7d) and 30 days (30d). The percentage change in price is higher for the 7-day and 30-day intervals compared to the 1-day interval. This indicates that Bitcoin has shown a positive trend in price over the past 30 days, with the highest volatility in the 7-day interval.

# For Ethereum, the prices have decreased slightly over the past day (1d), while showing a moderate increase over the past 7 days (7d) and 30 days (30d). The percentage change in price is also higher for the 7-day and 30-day intervals compared to the 1-day interval. This indicates that Ethereum has shown a moderate positive trend in price over the past 30 days, with moderate volatility in the 7-day interval.

# Overall, we can see that both cryptocurrencies have shown positive trends in price over the past 30 days, with the highest volatility in the 7-day interval. However, the overall price trends and volatility can vary greatly based on other time frames, such as hourly or monthly intervals, and further analysis would be needed to fully understand the patterns in the data.
